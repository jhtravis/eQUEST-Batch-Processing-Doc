# Functioning
The basic work-flow of the batch processing is the following:

![Batch Processing Work-flow](eQUEST-Batch-Processing.svg)
## Batch Master and Tables
### Batch Master
It contains a description of all the simulations the user wish to run as well as general batch processing parameters. The detailed structure of a batch master file is presented in Sample Files.
### Tables
The tables contain all the different values of parameters or DOE-2 keywords used in the simulations. The detailed structure of a table is presented in Sample Files.
## eQUEST
The batch processing feature in eQUEST is in the Tools menu of the main task bar. 

![Location of the Batch Processing Feature in eQUEST](eQUEST-Batch-Processing-Feature.png)

Depending on your installation the batch processing feature might be greyed-out. To activate it, locate the eQUEST.INI (or eQUESTDOE23.INI if you are using DOE-2.3) in the eQUEST data folder (usually located in Documents\eQUEST 3-**** Data\). Open it in a text editor and locate the following entry:
> EnableBatchProcessing=0

Change its value from 0 to 1. If this entry is not present in your eQUEST.INI file add it under:

> [preferences]
## Input Files and DOE-2 Simulations
The input files are created by eQUEST using the batch master and its tables. eQUEST generates and simulates each input file sequentially.
## BatchMaster-Out.csv
The energy use, energy demand and energy cost for each runs are stored in a csv file located in the same folder as the batch master. This folder will have a "-OUT" suffix added onto the name of the batch master. It is imporant to note that this is not the only output generated by the batch processing. Since all the files are simulated using DOE-2 all the usual output files of a DOE-2 runs are still being created. This file is not the only output file that can be generated by the batch processing. Some additional output file can be created. For more information, refer to Sample Files.
