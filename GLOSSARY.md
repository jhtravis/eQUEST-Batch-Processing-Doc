## BDBase

BDBase is the intermediate database that drives eQUEST's wizard. When a project is created using the wizard, all the BDBase keywords that have been specified get converted to BDL keywords by a set of hard-coded rules (in eQUEST's source code).

## BDL

BDL stands for Building Description Language. It is used to write input file for the DOE-2 whole-building energy simulation engine. A typical file written using BDL includes a series of instructions which are made of commands, keywords and values. Fore more information, please refer to the DOE-2 help file, Volume 1: Basics, Building Description Language.

## EOF
