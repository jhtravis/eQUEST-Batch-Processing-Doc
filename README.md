# eQUEST Batch Processing Documentation

This document provides a detailed documentation of eQUEST's batch processing capabilities. [eQUEST](http://www.doe2.com/equest/) is a powerful graphical user interface for the [DOE-2.2](http://doe2.com/DOE2/index.html) whole-building hourly simulation program. This documentation is not supported by the eQUEST development team or funded by any organization. This document is meant to be a collaborative effort and was created in order to strengthen the knowledge base of the eQUEST/DOE-2 users community. Any modifications, improvements or corrections to this document would be greatly appreciated.

> Batch processing is the execution of a series of jobs in a program on a computer without manual intervention (non-interactive).

In the context of whole-building energy simulation, batch processing is the execution of a series of simulation without having interact with the simulation software.
